Here's somecurrent information on the recent 'wave of DVR attacks' (as 
documented by IPVM.com and others). I'm hoping it will facilitate the
diagnosing of symptoms of malfunctioning devices.

Attacks against Hikvision units: 

* Common logins (12345, 654321, 111111 etc) are attempted via common web
  interface ports through the PSIA API. If successful, the unit's network
  settings are randomized, and if this does not disconnect the unit then
  a factory reset is attempted. The symptoms are either a device which 
  has lost its usual IP, or a factory reset unit.
* If the above attack does not work, the recently disclosed Montecrypto 
  authentication bypass (CVE-2017-7921, ICSA-17-124-01) is attempted. 
  Under this condition only a factory reset is carried out. The symptoms 
  in this case are a factory reset device.
* If the unit has an exposed telnetd interface, some (to my knowledge 
  0-day, no CVE exists) attacks are attempted which will either brick or
  fork bomb the unit, or prevent it from booting up at next reboot. The 
  symptoms of this attack vary and are very firmware dependent.

Attacks against Dahua units:

* 'Bashis Generation 2 and 3' authentication bypasses (CVE-2017-7927, 
  ICSA-17-124-02) are attempted against the web interface. The first 
  viable-looking account in the userlist is targeted (usually 888888). 
  If login is successful, camera settings are tampered with to dim the 
  feeds and display "HACKED" as a watermark. Recently some feeds will 
  also get the text "UPGRADE" and "FIRMWARE" for additional clarity. 
  Unit's network settings are tampered with in an attempt to disconnect 
  the vulnerable unit from the WAN.
* If unit has an exposed telnetd interface some well-known backdoor 
  account logins (CVE-2013-3612) are attempted, and on successful login 
  the unit will be bricked. The symptoms in this case will be a bricked 
  device, all partitions overwritten with random data.
* If port 6789's or 19058's management interface is open to the WAN an 
  attempt is made to extract the userlist from the data port 37777 
  (CVE-2013-6117). If a hash is successfully extracted an attempt to 
  reverse it is carried out (CVE-2013-3615). If hash reversing isn't 
  successful or port 37777 isn't exploitable then common logins are used 
  instead. On successful management interface login the unit will be 
  bricked. The symptoms in this case will be a bricked device, with all 
  partitions overwritten with random data. Although these vulnerabilities
  are now 4 years old there are still sadly some new units appearing 
  every day.

Attacks against XiongMai units (often sold as whitelabeled/noname DVRs):

* Login and password hash is extracted via CVE-2017-7577. If successful 
  an attempt is made to reverse the hash (which is similarily weak as 
  Dahua CVE-2013-3615), and some further web commands are carried out 
  which attempt to tamper with the camera settings through the dvrcmd 
  API. If the unit has exposed its management interface on port 9527 to 
  the WAN the reversed hash will be used to log in and attempt to brick 
  the unit (approx 70% success rate), or tamper with its network settings
  to disconnect it from the WAN. 
* If the unit has an exposed telnetd interface some well-known backdoor 
  account logins are attempted, and if successful the unit will be 
  bricked.
* If unit is still online after approx 90 minutes then a (to my knowledge
  an unknown buffer overflow vulnerability) is used to crash the unit's 
  daemons non-stop for the next 5-8 hours. This is done in an attempt to 
  encourage the owner to manually reboot the unit to clear any resident 
  malware and hopefully re-expose its vulnerable telnetd interface on 
  bootup. 

  The symptoms of the above XiongMai attacks vary. The unit might be 
  bricked (all partitions overwritten) outright, or it could be in a 
  constant restart cycle (which might look like the unit is constantly 
  rebooting but it's just restarting the crashing server process). In 
  this case it's best to unplug the device from the Internet before 
  rebooting it as the reboot might expose its telnetd to a bricking 
  attack.

Attacks against TVT units (whitelabeled, many vendors):

* RCE is attempted via the web interface (EDB-ID 39596). If vulnerable 
  the unit will be bricked and partitions overwritten with random data.

Attacks against Hanbang Gaoke units (typically branded 'Smart DVR'):

* CVE-2017-14335 is attempted to reset the admin password. If web login 
  is successful, the unit's disk is formatted, the network settings are 
  tampered with to disconnect it from the WAN, and the watermark 
  overlays of the first 4 cameras are updated to say "HACKED"

Symptoms and behaviors of some common IP camera-specific attacks:

Attacks against Avtech units:

* Authentication bypass (EDB-ID 40500) is attempted via the web 
  interface. If login is successful bricking is attempted via associated 
  RCEs, and if these are unsuccessful the camera's network settings are 
  scrambled to disconnect it from the WAN. Symptoms range from unit being
  bricked (partitions overwritten with random data) or the camera losing 
  its usual IP. 
* As a fallback CVE-2013-4981 is attempted in order to simply crash the 
  unit until it's manually rebooted. 

Attacks against Wificam units (whitelabeled, many vendors):

* CVE-2017-8225 is attempted via the web interface to extract device 
  configuration. On successful login bricking is attempted via associated
  RCEs, and if these are unsuccessful the unit's network settings are 
  tampered with in an attempt to disconnect it. If the unit is still 
  online (this happens for approx 15% of units) some additional camera 
  settings are tampered with in a bid to get the owner's attention (for 
  example camera's PTZ is configured to endlessly patrol up and down).

My botnet was originally designed to disable systems infected with IoT
and router malware (such as Mirai) so there are payloads for a wide range
of devices but the above are currently the most commonly executed NVR and 
camera payloads by far. I'm estimating over 1.1m units affected with the 
above payloads since mid-September, and that includes 564k Hikvisions and 
379k Dahuas. That may sound like a lot for three weeks but the numbers 
pale in comparison to the poorly secured consumer ISP and telco networks 
which are still the primary threat. It's in any case noteworthy that so 
many vulnerable units were easily accessible on the Internet months after 
the manufacturers issued security bulletins and patches. The current 
methodology for getting critical security patches to these devices is 
clearly dangerously ineffective.

I strongly recommend that any IoT devices such as NVRs and IP cameras are
protected behind a VPN or firewall rather than placed directly on the 
Internet. Changing the public listening port of a vulnerable device will 
only delay the inevitable and it will sooner or later pose a threat to 
the rest of the Internet.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience that has been caused, and I hope this 
information helps. I keep seeing postings on CCTV forums where people 
describe exact symptoms of these attacks, and in all cases the solution
(and prevention) would simply have been to protect the vulnerable devices
from open Internet access. 

As a final thought I believe much of the current IoT security mess could
be fixed or at least significantly improved by establishing badly secured
devices as 'attractive nuisances.' Victims of DDoS with solid legal 
support (such as Akamai or Verisign) could in theory accelerate the 
matter through our courts (think of your bandwidth savings in 2017 as my
contribution towards your legal costs :P). There's generally no doubt 
regarding the origin of Layer 7 attacks and all it would take would be 
two or three precedents against a negligent device owner to start 
changing the liability landscape. Whether or not it's the device owner 
or the device manufacturer who actually owns the (liability) problem is 
best determined on a case-by-case basis.
